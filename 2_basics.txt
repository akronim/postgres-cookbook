You can use the `psql` command to create a user and database:
psql postgres --u postgres

Type this command for creating a new user with password. 
postgres-# CREATE ROLE djamware WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'dj@mw@r3';

Then give access for creating the database.
postgres-# ALTER ROLE djamware CREATEDB;

Quit `psql` then log in again using the new user that previously created.
postgres-# \q
psql postgres -U djamware
Enter the password, then you will enter this `psql` console.

Type this command to creating a new database.
postgres=> CREATE DATABASE book_store;

Then give that new user privileges to the new database then quit the `psql`.
postgres=> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE book_store TO djamware;
postgres=> \q
